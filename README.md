# Checkmate üïµÔ∏è

## Automated checklist inspector for your pull requests

## Features

## Configuration

In your PR description or issue template, place `<!--Checkmate-->` above the checklist block you want validated. A block of checklist
items is one without empty lines in-between.

```markdown
#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist

<!--Checkmate-->

- [ ] Added or updated documentation
- [x] Tests for new functionality and regression tests for bug fixes

### This checklist will not be validated

- [ ] This is ignored
- [ ] This is ignored

```

Then configure the action in your workflow like

```yaml
on:
  # Run against PR description changes
  pull_request:
    types: [edited]

name: Checklist Check
jobs:
  checkmate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
